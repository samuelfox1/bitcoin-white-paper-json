# Bitcoin White Paper to JSON

This tool uses the [pdf-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse) npm package to read the [bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper) pdf file and create a JSON file with the sections of the paper. As a bonus, a few screenshots are included for the corresponding sections.
